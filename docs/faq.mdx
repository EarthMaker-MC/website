## Map creation
### Do you build your maps block by block?
No sorry, it would take too long to get only one map out. We're using a software that generates the maps instead.

### How are your maps generated?
We're using a tool called <a href="https://earth.motfe.net/" target="_BLANK">EarthTiles</a>, which allows us to get data from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target="_BLANK">OpenStreetMap</a>, and convert it to a proper Minecraft map.

### Are thoses maps made for Java edition or Bedrock edition?
Our maps are made for Java edition. But you may convert them to Bedrock edition if you want.  
If you're using a Windows computer, you may download <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9PC9MFX9QCXS" target="_BLANK">this app from the Microsoft Store</a> to convert to bedrock. Otherwise, you can <a href="https://je2be.app/" target="_BLANK">run the tool from your browser (slower)</a>.

### Next map when?
Once ready!

### Are the maps free?
For now, yes, all of our maps are free. We're planning to launch paid maps at some point in the future, but all existing maps wil remain free.

### Can you generate a map for me?
We can, but it would be a commissioned work. Prices vary according to the size of the map and the time taken to generate it.

## Downloading maps
### What are the .001, .002, .003, ... files?
We split our maps in 45GB chunks. This means you'll need to download all of the chunks to open the final file. 

### How do I open the 001, 002, 003, ... files?
Simply download <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_BLANK">7-Zip</a> and open the 001 file in this program. If you can't open the file, make sure you downloaded every chunk, and make sure to verify the MD5 hash for each chunk.

### How do I verify the MD5 hash for a file?
Take a look at <Link to="/docs/getting-started/get-maps#verifying-integrity-of-the-maps">our map downloading guide</Link>.

## Usage
### Can I use your map on my public server?
Of course you can, as long you don't claim you created the map yourself!  
We'd appreciate if you could at least link back to our homepage however.

### Even on a server that has a shop?
Yes!

### I'm using your map on my server. Can I advertise it?
We got a server list on our <a href="https://download.earthmaker.world">Discord server</a>. Take a look at the requirements and submit your server!

### How can I convert GPS coordinates to Minecraft coordinates? (and vice-versa)
DerMattinger got you covered. Open <a href="https://earth.motfe.net/coordinate-calculator/" target="_BLANK">this link</a> and select <code>3584</code> under "Blocks per tile" and <code>1</code> under Tiles per map.

### Can I donate to you?
Of course you can! You can proceed through GitHub Sponsors, using the widget right below :  
<GitHubSponsorsBox />
But you'll probably want to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mattingersoftwaresolution" target="_BLANK">donate to DerMattinger</a>, the developer of the tool we use to generate the maps too. (make sure to join his <a href="https://discord.gg/minecraft-earth-map-656100677755338753" target="_BLANK">Discord server</a> too).

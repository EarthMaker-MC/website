To get started, you need to join our Discord.

### Why?
Discord is probably the best place we can find to keep you updated about updates on EarthMaker. It also allows you to get your server featured on our currated community server list.

### How?
Just join our server using <a href="https://download.earthmaker.world" target="_BLANK">this link</a>. Signup for a Discord account if you need one, and that's it. If you can see the "readme-first" channel, please DM an admin to receive that shiny `Visitor` role.

Once you joined, you're good to go.

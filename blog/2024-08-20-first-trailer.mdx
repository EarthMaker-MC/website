### Context
I thing I need to give you some context. You may or may not remember [the PlanetMinecraft incident](./2024-05-27-hello-world.mdx).  
Being on PlanetMinecraft has a huge advantage. It's a community-trusted website, which has been there for a long time. And with half a million of maps (578,460 and counting as of today), it is easy to find a specific map. And since this website has here for a long time, it has a really good SEO score, meaning whoever posts their projects there have a high chance to be discoverable through Google or any search engine.  
In fact, that's because we were using PlanetMinecraft that we had new members joining on a regular basis (sometimes we had 3-4 people joining the same day).

And as expected, since we removed all of our maps from the website, we got less and less people joining the server.

As a reminder, don't harrass the PlanetMinecraft staff. Their rules made sense, and the problem was on our side the whole time.

### Back to the sketching board
Making a website to showcase our map was only the first phase to move out of PlanetMinecraft. The issue is that our SEO score is low. A way to improve it is to have backlinks from a website that has a high SEO score.
Most social media won't make it easy for search engines to discover the content and index it. But YouTube does.  
    
That's where the trailers comes in. YouTube has a good seo score, and we might be able to eventually link back our website in the video description. At the very least, we would be able to redirect people to our website.  
Another thing to do would be to make a Shorts version of the trailer. Lots of people are watching YouTube Shorts, so that's another way to get more attention.
  
### Making trailer
Now that we know what to do, it's time to pick a map. I choose the Switzerland map because it was the first map we ever released.  
To record, all I used was the good old <a href="https://replaymod.com" target="_blank">Replay Mod</a>, with the <a href="https://bdcraft.net/downloads/purebdcraft-minecraft/" target="_blank">PureBDCraft 256x resource pack</a> and the <a href="https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/" target="_blank">Sildur's Vibrant Extreme Shaders</a>. As simple as that.

### The result
That's it, after 3-4 hours of work, the trailer is ready! And the Shorts version too!
Here is the result:

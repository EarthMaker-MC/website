Oh my days !! Finally an Asian map!  
Remember how last time was the [P-day](./2025-11-26-poland-release.mdx)? Guess what? Today is the S-day! No, we're not talking about Samsung's flagship models, we're talking about silicon.  
Yes finally! While we mainly focuse on Europe (useful as the countries are small !), we've decided to generate other maps from other continents to vary our portfolio!

### Taiwan is in the place!

We are so happy to release this new map following our schedule, yes the one you do not have access to ([or don't you?](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx)).
Well, we let you make your own opinion by downloading the map. And as usual, our maps are free of charge until further notice!  
Don't hesitate to join our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) to download the map!  

### Trailer and...

Cheers to [Geek](/blog/authors/geek) who again produced the trailer and DALIX who reviewed it!  
Our shorts are still on their way to be published on a new platform soon, stay tuned it!

Enjoy the new trailer!

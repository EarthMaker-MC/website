Oh my days !! Finally an Asian map!
Yes finally! We mainly focuse on Europe (useful as the countries are small !) but we decided to gen other maps from other continents!

### Taiwan is in the place!

We are so happy to release this new map following our schedule, yes the one you do not have access to.
Well, we let you make your own opinion by downloading the map. And as usual, our maps are free of charge until further notice!  
Don't hesitate to join our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) to download the map!  

### Trailer and...

Cheers to [Geek](/blog/authors/geek) who again produced the trailer and DALIX who reviewed it!  
Our shorts are still on their way to be published on a new platform soon, stay tuned it!

Enjoy the new trailer!

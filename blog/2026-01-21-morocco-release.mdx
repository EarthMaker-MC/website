What ? This is not a European map ? Finally!
Hell yeah, we also generated some maps that are not European countries, and here is the Morocco one !

{/* truncate */}
### Morocco, first African map for EarthMaker !

Yes, our first African map ! Morocco is a well-known (really?) country that is quite big by the way. And yes, usually, generating African countries take even more time than for European ones, as they are much bigger.
But here we did with Morocco !!
As usual, just join our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) to download the map!  

Enjoy the map !!

### Trailer

Here is the trailer! By the way, our short trailer versions are also uploaded on TikTok and may appear soon on our Instagram page.

Enjoy !

Geek's footnote: I'll use raw Debian as my daily driver distribution if we reach 1000 members by the end of the year (how likely is this even?). If you wanna see me suffer, you know what to do

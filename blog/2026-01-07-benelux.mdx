Happy new year 2026 to all of you who are reading this blog!  
After the French map release, it's now time for the Benelux one!
{/* truncate */}
### Bene what ?

Benediction, beneficial ? No, that's Benelux!! Also called "Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg", but it's quite long to write and sorry for you but I am quite a lazy guy (Geek's note: you're note alone). That's why we prefer to write it in a shortened way as BENELUX.
As usual, just join our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) to download the map!  

Enjoy the map ;)!

### Trailer

Here is the trailer! By the way, our short trailer versions are also uploaded on TikTok and may appear soon on our Instagram page.

Enjoy !

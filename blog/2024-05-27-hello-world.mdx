### Introducing... EarthMaker.world
That's it! If you are reading this, then welcome to this website!  
Is there a reason for this site to exist? Nope!  
Should it have existed? Nope!  
Does it exist in spite of everything? Yop!  
Stick around to see why this website actually exists.

### The PlanetMinecraft incident
:::danger[Warning]
Please don't harrass PlanetMinecraft staff. They do a wonderful job, and the whole issue was on our end.
:::

Back in the day, when we launched the project, we were not really known at all (and now we got over 300 members, which is way beyond our expectations).
We created a PlanetMinecraft account, to show around our maps, hopefully some people would notice (and yes, people noticed).

And everything went well, until that day, where all of our maps (but 3 for some reason) were taken down. 

<img src="/img/blog/2024-05-27-takedown.png" alt="REDACTED moderated you for Minecraft Switzerland Map 1:30 Map. Mod action: Disabled, Reason: Other, Content temporarily disabled until changes are made. If providing a download, it must be through the Download button, not the description nor a Discord server. This is to properly label content as monetized or not in our system."></img>

However, there was more than just a link issue. We tried to appeal for one map only (to save both our and PMC's staff time), and we learned about a rule that makes the whole project forbidden on PMC.

<img src="/img/blog/2024-05-27-review.png" alt="Additionally, if your maps are made simply by converting a heightmap to a Minecraft map via a string of programs then this is also not allowed, no matter how many hours you spend running files through a program to convert them, if this is what you are doing do not request review for this post."></img>

To be fair, that rule actually makes sense, yet in that case it wouldn't be possible to build our maps by hand, a block at a time.

### Moving on

We then had to comply, and removed all of our maps from PlanetMinecraft. The only way we now have to gain attention is to have our own website... A website like the one you're currently viewing.

:::info[Random fact]
We first planned to get the `earthmaker.ch` domain, but we figured out the `earthmaker.world` domain was available at a decent price, so we took this one instead!
:::

Of course, we won't get the same attention we had on PlanetMinecraft, so if you enjoy our maps, feel free to share our website with your friends!

Instead of posting the maps on PlanetMinecraft, we'll post them on this website, and we'll make teasers to post on our <a href="https://youtube.com/@earthmaker-mc" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.

### Closing thoughts

I'd like to apologie to the PlanetMinecraft staff for wasting their time and breaking their rules.  
Also, again, please don't harass them (screenshot was slightly censored for a reason), they are doing a wonderful job at moderating their website, which even in 2024 is still a good place to find awesome Minecraft content.

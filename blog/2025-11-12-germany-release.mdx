As [promised](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx) about a month and a half ago, we're releasing [our Germany map](/maps/europe/germany).

{/* truncate */}

### Are we there yet?
Yes! As usual, our maps are free until further notice! So all you have to do is to join our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) and download the map!  

### New trailer
Our [last trailer](./2025-10-14-korea-release.mdx) generated more engagement than our previous trailers. Seriously! We went from 22 subscribers to 37 in the span of a week (I did the math, that's about a 73% increase!).

In the previous trailers, the recording and camera effects were done using the good old <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/replaymod?utm_src=earthmaker&utm_medium=blog" target="_blank">ReplayMod</a>, but I realized it was sometimes rendering choppy videos.  
To avoid this issue, I tried out <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/flashback?utm_src=earthmaker&utm_medium=blog">Flashback</a>. This mode has more features, and does not have this issue. At least until now. There are only one major I could find to Flashback when comparing both mods: the export duration is longer on Flashback. Otherwise, the upgrade was worth it.

Enjoy the new trailer!

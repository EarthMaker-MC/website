Happy new year, everyone! May this new year bring you joy, (good) surprises, and [new EarthMaker maps](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx#fresh-update-and-new-maps) (stay tuned)!  
2025 has been a good year for EarthMaker, so let's rewind and see what we've done this year.
{/* truncate */}

### Support us
Back in January 2025, we launched our GitHub Sponsors profile.  
In 2025, we received a total of **2** donations, for a total amount of **$25**.  
Generating maps costs money, and so does hosting them, so if you find our maps useful, feel free to make a donation through the box below:  
<GitHubSponsorsBox />  
Of course, do NOT donate if you can't afford it. You can instead spread the word about our maps too!  

### _Small_ break
In June, we took a 3-month break, during which I rewrote the download part of our Discord bot to serve the maps in a faster and more efficient way. I used to be able to download the maps at 10 MB/s, now I can download the same maps at 50 MB/s!  

### New maps
Before our break, we were able to generate some maps, yet we never released them. We fixed this by releasing these maps starting in October 2025 and continuing until February 2026.  
In 2025, we released **6** maps. And we may (or may not) release even more in 2026. Stay tuned!

### Updated maps
In 2025, we updated **1** map, which was the Spain map. We replaced it with the Iberia map which of course contains Spain, but also Portugal.

### Trailers
In 2025, we released **12** trailers (2 for each map, a vertical version and a long version).  
Our [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@earthmaker-mc) gained 36 subscribers (for a total of 56), our videos were viewed 10,638 times, for a total watch time of 25.3 hours. Most of the views came from our vertical trailers which explains why we had 1000x more views than last year, yet our watch time was only about 7% greater than in 2024.  
Our top 3 most viewed trailers were:
* Long form:
  3. Switzerland Trailer (306 views, made in 2024)
  2. Poland Trailer (336 views)
  1. Korea Trailer (504 views)
* Short form:
  3. United Kingdom / Ireland Trailer (1,696 views)
  2. Germany Trailer (1,704 views)
  1. Poland Trailer (1,877 views)
  1. Taiwan Trailer (1,877 views)
This is correct, two of our short form trailers got the same amount of views.

### Hello TikTok...
In 2025, we launched our [TikTok profile](https://tiktok.com/@earthmaker_mc), hoping to gain more visibility. So far, none of our trailers have passed the 220 views mark. If you use TikTok, make sure to drop us a follow!

### ...and hello Instagram.
In 2025, we also launched our [Instagram profile](https://instagram.com/earthmaker_mc). It is currently empty, but we'll publish our trailers on this platform too, going forward.

### Some Discord stats
In 2025, **1,712** messages were sent on our Discord server, across all channels. The most active channel was of course our general chat, with **882** messages.  
**107** people joined our server this year, either to download maps, maybe talk, or just to download a map and leave.  
We ended the year with **314** members on our Discord server.  
I promised I would install Arch Linux as my main OS if we reached 333 members before the end of the year. The goal was not reached, but I'll relaunch the challenge for this year.  
Do you want me to install ~~and suffer~~ with Arch Linux? It's very easy, simply join our Discord server, and if we reach 333 members (or more) at the end of the year, I'll do it once I manage to buy RAM (and other components) at a decent price.

### Hello 2026
This is not the end of EarthMaker, we still have some maps to release (stay tuned, the Benelux map drops next week).  
Stay funky, and take care!

Do you remember when we [announced](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx#fresh-update-and-new-maps) new maps to be released in the coming weeks?  
Well, as promised, it's now time for us to release today [our Korea map](/maps/asia/korea).  

{/* truncate */}

### What's included?

I'll keep it short, the Korea map includes territory from both North and South Korea.  
As always, you are welcome to use this map on your server for any purpose.

### New trailer

Last time, you might remember that I lost my thermal paste tube.  
Guess what? I've since managed to get my computer up and running again.

This means we also have a new trailer for our map!

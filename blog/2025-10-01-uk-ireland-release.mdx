In our [last blog post](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx), we talked about [our future plans for EarthMaker](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx#the-future-of-earthmaker), but we also have [announced](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx#fresh-update-and-new-maps) new maps to be released in the coming weeks.  
As promised, we're releasing today [our United-Kingdom / Ireland map](/maps/europe/uk-ireland).

### Wait... How?

While discussing our future maps with some friends, I was asked this question several times:  

> You guys don't have a server to generate maps anymore. How comes you can generate new maps?  

And that question made sense, because they were missing a key piece of information.  
We had used our previous server to (almost) its full potential.  

### When procrastination becomes your best friend...

At the time, we had planned around eight maps even before renting a new server to generate maps. Then we finally rented the said server. We [discussed](./2025-09-25-we-are-back.mdx#the-future-of-earthmaker) the hardware specs (and some software specs too!) in the previous blog post, if you're interested.  
This allowed us to regenerate the maps that had either some quality issues or weren't as detailed as they were meant to be.  

Once the maps that required updating or regeneration had been completed, we then commenced work on new maps.  

A few months later, these maps were all ready to go. But we wanted to make a trailer alongside the release of the maps.  
While I am not in a position to speak on behalf of all trailer makers, I can say with confidence that the part of the process that takes me the longest is the recording of the footage and the application of the camera effects.  

And so... I had considered postponing this task.  
This was until we ceased generating maps for the time being.

### Semi-revival

Fast forward until september.  
We have prepared our "classic" maps for download. However, we also had our unreleased maps that were awaiting public release.  

We had sufficient unreleased maps to release one every other week for a period of five months.  

This gave me enough motivation to make trailers for the upcomming maps.

<sup><sub>Oh and by the way we had a Fr\*nce trailer in the making, but it got cancelled...</sub></sup>

### New trailer

You might think I'm the only one making the trailers. And... you're wrong.  

It's true that I'm the one recording the footage and editing the trailers, but I'm always assisted by [Ã¤lg](/blog/authors/alg) (helping choosing which places we showcase in the trailers) and DALIX for visual assets. And they review the trailer before we publish it too!  

And after a few hours of work, our new trailer is finally ready:

</div>

And I was glad I finished the trailer early enough, as I then opened my laptop to fix the overheat issues I had by cleaning the dust, and replacing the thermal paste, then I realized I lost my thermal paste tube...

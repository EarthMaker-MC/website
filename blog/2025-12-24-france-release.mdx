Merry Christmas to all of you celebrating! 🎄  
Today, we're releasing our France map, as we promised some months ago!
*Ewwww... Fr\*nce!*
{/* truncate */}
### New record!

That's right, this map is our biggest release... yet (stay tuned™️). You will need 123GB of storage on your computer to download all of the parts, and the uncompressed map is about 145GB. Will people even download it? I have no clue...
As usual, just join our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) to download the map!  

### Failed attempt...

I always record the trailers with 32 chunks of render distance. But over the last weeks, a mod has gone viral, called [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy). Its permise is pretty simple: have 2048 chunks of render distance, without compromising FPS, thanks to the power of level of details (aka LODs).  
Importing this map into Voxy took litteral hours (and ate 128GB of storage in the process). But once the chunks were rendered, the performance hit was unnoticeable.  
However, Flashback, yet supported by Voxy seemed to keep some kind of hole between the LODs and the actual chunks. I will retry later on, hopefully when the mod will be less unstable.

### ...(almost) lost media

I'm not even joking, we were planning on making a trailer a while (almost a year ago!) back, but it never got ready. We almost lost any evidence of it. But I managed to get the first few seconds of the said version. Here they are, before they become lost media:

### Trailer

Of course, I had to make a trailer for this brand new map. So here is it, with my render distance set to 32 chunks.  
Enjoy!

Last reminder: we're trying to reach 333 members on our [Discord server](https://download.earthmaker.world) by the end of the year. If we succeed, I'll install Arch Linux as my next OS. Make sure to share the EarthMaker project to anybody who might be interested in our maps!
